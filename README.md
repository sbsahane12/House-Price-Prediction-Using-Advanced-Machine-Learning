# [Project 1: House Price Prediction Using Advanced Machine Learning](https://github.com/sbsahane12/House-Price-Prediction-Using-Advanced-Machine-Learning.git)
This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a House Price Prediction system for a House dataset.
## AIM:
- Predict the price of house on the basis of features
## Role & Responsibility: 
- Based on my learnings and course of Machine Learning, where I studied different steps to follow in a Machine learning problem such as finding approprate columns, handling missing data, fixing categorical columns and using different ways to test the data based on our initial assumptions and finally applying XGBoost to predict the output.Trained and test multiple machine Learning supervised classification algorithms and achieved the 0.862746 accuracy score.
